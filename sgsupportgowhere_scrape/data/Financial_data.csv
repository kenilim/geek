Your bill will have up to  200 deducted from it.Paddy Chew Empowerment FundStarted in 1998  our longest-running empowerment subsidy to provide critical and timely financial support to lower the cost of living. Some of Anti-retroviral medications are classified as standard drugs in Singapore and the financial burden can deter adherence to treatment. To ensure that we incorporate GIPA principles  Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV AIDS   AFA supports PLHIV who give back to the community by participating in educational activities and AIDS awareness talks. In doing so  they help us reach and influence more people  and at the same time are voices for other PLHIVsHIV  Pregnant Mother s FundThe HIV  Pregnant Mothers Fund was established in 2007 to help eliminate vertical transmission of HIV.

In our encounters with affected families  the financial burden of treatment is cited as a key reason for patients failing to adhere to treatment. To offset some of the costs associated with living with HIV  AfA offers the Care for Family Fund subsidy to affected PLHIVs and their families.Applications for financial subsidy are submitted to AfA via medical social workers on behalf of their clients. This ensures that the appropriate needs assessment is done by social work professionals  and that all other avenues of government funding have already been exhausted prior to their application. With these measures in place  the financial assistance will reach individuals and families who are most in need.Emergency FundHigh levels of stigma  discrimination and ignorance mean that many people who are diagnosed with HIV could lose their jobs due to discrimination. The Emergency Fund aims to provide support to young PLHIV   lt 30 years  who have been terminated from their employment due to their HIV status for an interim period.
