Elevate the Streets;"Elevate the Streets is an initiative that aims to bridge street subcultures with social services through workshops  events and outreach.
On 10th March 2019  some of us gathered in a cozy apartment  and we had a crazy idea. We wanted to apply our common love for breaking to serving a greater cause. Our central idea was simple  breaking had empowered us  and can similarly empower others.
Troubled and disaffected youths often benefit from having an anchor in their formative years to channel their energies productively. This led us to explore breaking as a way to reach out to youth communities. In fact  this concept of reaching out through hip-hop is a core part of the culture  tied in with its well-known elements of  Peace  Love  Unity and Having Fun .
With these thoughts and convictions  we started a movement that championed all that is positive about being involved in subcultures   the community  the values  and the potential for social impact. Through Elevate the Streets  we hope to become a gateway where outsiders can have an enriched understanding of what it means to practice b-boying  dj-ing  graffiti  parkour  and other subcultures in Singapore.";https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource 3pQPhg5E5Zz;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;They can be contacted through form in their website;Elevate the Streets elevatethestreets@gmail.com Website;https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource 3pQPhg5E5Zz

Kid s Weekday Care - YWCA;"Supporting Underprivileged Children
Replacing the former Kids  Club programme which ran from 2007 to 2015  the YWCA Kids  Weekday Care  KWC  programme was set up in 2016 to provide afterschool care to latch-key children from low-income families. It was created in response to demand for afterschool care needs from our beneficiary families under our Meals-on-Wheels  https   ywca.org.sg food-distribution meals-on-wheels   programme.
The thrice-weekly afterschool care service covers two-way transport from school and back to their respective homes  halal lunch and a structured care schedule at a highly subsidised cost.
The care programme aims to provide social  emotional  moral and academic support to disadvantaged children by creating a rewarding and conducive environment for them to develop their self-worth and character  discover their unique potential  and strive for excellence. In doing so  it perpetuates YWCA s endeavours to offer a more holistic approach to helping children from low-income families under the Meals-on-Wheels programme and those who are referred by schools.
The Kids  Weekday Care focuses on the overall development of children through a broad range of activities such as tutoring  mentorship  enrichment  soft skills and life skills workshops  outings and group work. Service and value-based learning is emphasized  as well as work in alliance with parents. Casework and counselling will be available for children who require it.
