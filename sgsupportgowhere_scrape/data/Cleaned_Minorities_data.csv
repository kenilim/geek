FareGo TWC2;Unable to work injured workers often find themselves with a financial problem in addition to their worries over recovery. In theory they are entitled to salary or medical leave wages if the doctor has prescribed medical leave but in reality bureaucratic or other reasons often mean payment is badly delayed. Moreover because of their low salaries they have no savings. Virtually broke injured workers find that they do not even have the means to pay for transport to the hospital for their medical appointments or physiotherapy.nbsp They simply dont have money for transport.TWC2s FareGo programme provides small sums to injured workers so that they can top up their transport fare cards. Strict qualifying criteria are applied Applicants must be able to demonstrate that they are not allowed to work that they have an upcoming medical appointment and that a stipulated exclusion period since the last topup has passed.Although at an individual level the subsidies provided are small the total amount adds up to over 30000 annually since there are so many workers in need.;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourceZFWzNeAPfhT;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"FareGo TWC2   Leaflet  OneMap  contributors  Singapore Land Authority 180B Bencoolen Street 0901

Medical Care TWC2;In a typical year the largest of our Care Fund programmes goes to providing medical care. Whilst the law obliges employers to purchase insurance and thereby provide medical care the law also sets out maximum limits to this obligation. There is a cap on how much medical costs need be borne by employers for injuries or illnesses. The cap is not unrealistic  in the main almost all cases would not require more medical care than permitted by the cap.Invariably however there will be outliers. These would be workers who have suffered such severe injures necessitating major brain surgery or reconstructive surgery for example that costs far exceed the amount employers are obliged to pay for. From time to time too workers come down with illnesses that may require long stays in hospitals or complex treatment again beyond the legal cap.Some employers go well beyond their legal obligation picking up the tab for extra medical care. Others do not. And thats where TWC2 has to come in on a humanitarian basis to ensure that the ill or injured worker does not see his treatment truncated and his suffering prolonged.TWC2 weighs each case very carefully. High priority is given to cases where surgery or medical treatment has a high chance of restoring the patient to an active working life so that he or she can continue to be a breadwinner. Where the prognosis is poor we scale our support accordingly.;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcew3kaMayrxnQ;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"Medical Care TWC2   Leaflet  OneMap  contributors  Singapore Land Authority 180B Bencoolen Street 0901

Project Roof TWC2;Under the law employers are required to continue to house their former employees till their cases are concluded and they go home or they have found a new job. In reality workers  in the hundreds and maybe thousands  find it impossible to stay on in company quarters. They report a climate of intimidation and constant fear that the company would send in strongarmed repatriation agents in the middle of the night seizing them and bundling them off to the airport against their will. These fears are not unfounded. TWC2 has heard many firsthand reports of such repatriation tactics. In any event it is entirely conceivable that some companies may try all means to avoid the cost of housing their workers by making it difficult for them to stay on.Workers who flee company accommodation may borrow money from friends and relatives to rent a bunk space. But there are some with neither willing friends or relatives in Singapore.Project Roof helps subsidise their rent. The men find their own accommodation  typically a bunk in a crowded tenement in Little India  and subject to eligibility criteria and financial limits set out in our programme we help pay for it.It goes without saying that there are far more workers in need of such assistance than we can provide. Consequently we apply strict criteria chief of which is the severity of a workers nbspinjury. Top of the queue would be those who have recently had major surgery or have suffered a serious injury compromising his mobility and ability to help himself.;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresource47P26jWPLGU;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"Project Roof TWC2   Leaflet  OneMap  contributors  Singapore Land Authority 180B Bencoolen Street 0901

The Cuff Road Project TWC2;TWC2s free meals programme is called The Cuff Road Project. Begun in March 2008 it is the largest of TWC2s direct services. Other programmes are described in the section Care Fund Programmes.Based in Little India The Cuff Road Project offers a free breakfast and an ample dinner every weekday. On Saturday the meal provided is lunch. Our eligibility criteria are straightforward clients should be documented migrant workers who are out of a job.Why is there a need Migrant workers who are in dispute with their employers or are injured have no family here to fall back on. Although the law requires employers to provide upkeep and maintenance which in practice may be understood to mean accommodation and food the reality is that when the relationship has turned acrimonious employers may not fulfill their obligations willingly. Workers report facing enormous pressure to leave their dormitories. They also fear that continuing to stay in company housing exposes them to the risk of forcible repatriation before theyve received their due salaries or injury compensation. Many workers thus leave or are forced out of dormitories.They may have to borrow from friends to pay the monthly rent for a bunk. This leaves them with no margin to pay for adequate food. Especially when they are already injured poor nutrition may retard their recovery.TWC2s Cuff Road Project thus makes an important difference.On average we serve 400  500nbsp workers a day.TWC2s volunteers are stationed at the food point so that workers have someone to talk to and consult. We give advice on what rights and options they may have and how they can pursue their cases. Our volunteers also monitor their progress.The statistics that we compile from the cases we see at the Cuff Road Food Programme give us an overall picture of the kinds of difficulties and the scale of exploitation and abuse workers suffer.

Our trained volunteers offer psychosocial support to new clients who need help navigating the various recovery resources. Leveraging on lived experience our peer support volunteers share knowledge and model recovery to facilitate change. INDIVIDUAL COUNSELLING Counselling helps to address underlying issues that cause addiction in a personcentric manner. It is especially helpful in addressing acute issues or issues that may be too personal to address in a group setting. We provide inhouse counselling by professional counsellors. GROUP THERAPY Facilitated by trained professionals group therapy is an important means of examining the way we relate to ourselves and others so as to establish healthy and helpful ways of relating. This is especially important when the crutch of drugs and alcohol have been removed and acts as a future template for the ways we relate to others outside of a recovery setting. COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES A sense of connection is important to recovery and we emphasise community support as a means of ensuring that we do not feel alone in our struggles. We take great pains to foster a strong sense of community amongst our clients. Casual outings and festive celebrations help us safely build support networks that last. CHAT GROUP Our Greenhouse chat group provides a simple and convenient way to stay connected throughout the day. It is also a great way of getting support whenever we need to reach out for help. Checking in sharing recovery information as well as our daily victories and struggles helps us build healthy coping mechanisms that replace harmful behaviours.

Wednesday Clinic TWC2;In Singapore dispute resolution avenues for injury or salary claims are typified by a two or threestage process.For injury cases the first stage comprises administrative processes under the Ministry of Manpower keeping costs low for the claimant workers. Should one party disagree with the outcome of this stage an appeal can be made to the courts  this would be the second stage.For salary cases the first stage involves mediation organised by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management TADM. If this proves fruitless the case moves on to the Employment Claims Tribunal ECT for adjudication. No legal representation is allowed at either TADM or the ECT.These initial stages in both injury and salary cases may not require much in terms of financial outlay by claimant workers though extensive casework support is often needed. Our Wednesday Clinic team provides this intensive support helping migrant workers overcome educational language or evidentiary disadvantages during these administrative stages. For example many are unable to calculate exactly how much they are owed or how to tease out arguments from whatever documents they have.It is when a case goes beyond the administrative stages to the High Court in the form of appeals that costs kick in. Most cases dont get this far but when they do the financial weakness of migrant workers becomes a barrier to accessing justice. They need legal representation and there are all sorts of costs to be borne e.g. filing fees production or extraction of documents forensic reports fees for expert witnesses etc.;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourceRDwFW8W4H5G;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"Wednesday Clinic TWC2   Leaflet  OneMap  contributors  Singapore Land Authority 180B Bencoolen Street 0901
