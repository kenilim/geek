Many of the vulnerable individuals have little financial means and or social support  as well as mobility issues that make it difficult to care for themselves  let alone their homes. Driven by Habitat s belief that no human being should live in unsafe  unhygienic or undignified environment  Habitat for Humanity Singapore s Project HomeWorks was launched in 2006. We partner social services to identify such vulnerable persons and families who need help to rehabilitate their homes into a safe and sanitary state. 
During a Project HomeWorks session  we work with volunteers to make homes safer by decluttering items are pose a fire risk or could cause accidents like falls.
