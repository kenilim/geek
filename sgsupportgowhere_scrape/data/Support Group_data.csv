Caregiver Support Group (Caregiving Welfare Association),"The Caregiving Welfare Association (CWA) was established with the mission to improve the quality of life of elderly through dependable direct services, and to inculcate a generation of responsible and knowledgeable caregivers in an ageing population. Its services broadly fall under these three areas - Elderly Wellness &amp; Social Support, Welfare Support and Education &amp; Awareness.  
As part of the Caregiving Welfare Association (CWA) efforts to reach out to family caregivers, we encourage family caregivers to join us at our monthly caregiver support group sessions. 
Very often, caregivers are unaware of where to seek assistance from, many individuals end up bearing the heavy burden of looking after their loved ones themselves and suffering in silence. This affects them emotionally, physically and mentally – resulting in caregiver burnout at the end of the day.
We believe that there are many benefits which caregivers could gain from by participating in such group work. For example, individual gains mutual support from one another, and through the sharing of personal experiences, one could learn how to manage or even overcome such struggles eventually.
CWA currently runs three caregiver support groups for family caregivers to connect with one another – two English support groups (Art therapy and Mindfulness) and one Mandarin pilot support group. The English Art therapy support group session is conducted by our Art Therapist, Ms Jeanette Chan, and it will be held once a month on a Saturday morning from 9.30am to 11.30am. As for the English Mindfulness-based support group session, it will be conducted by Ms Erin Lee (Mindfulness Coach) once a month on a weekday from 2.30pm to 4.00pm. For the Mandarin pilot support group, this is catered for Mandarin-speaking caregivers. Currently, this session is conducted by an Art Therapist, Ms Ng Jue Ann, and runs once a month on a weekday afternoon from 2.30pm to 4.00pm.

Child Bereavement Support,"Child Bereavement Support (Singapore) is an informal network of bereaved parents who have all found that meeting other bereaved parents is what has made the biggest difference to us, and given us the most support, the most hope and the most comfort. People grieve in very different ways but we have all learned through our own experience that parent to parent support is just invaluable.
Our Objectives
CBSS was set up by bereaved parents for bereaved parents with very simple objectives: we provide support and friendship through a 'befriending' network, hold monthly support meetings, and maintain this website of resource and information to help bereaved parents find their way through their loss.  Where possible, we conduct CBSS talks on how to support bereaved families to doctors, nurses and medical students to promote compassion and understanding for families when death occurs on their watch.  
Our Reach
Being an independent, multi-cultural and multi-religious, parent-to-parent grouping, non-affiliated to any hospital or organisation, we are able to reach out to all bereaved parents in Singapore (of any race, religion or culture) who have suffered the loss of a baby or child - during pregnancy, in early infancy, at any stage of childhood, and even later into adulthood - and no matter in what circumstances or how recently or how long ago. We are open to any parent who needs support in their time of bereavement.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/amNHG96xh38,No Content Found,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,They can be contacted through form at https://www.cbss.sg/contact-us,Child Bereavement Support help@cbss.sg Website,https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/amNHG96xh38

Spark,"The Society for the Promotion of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Research &amp; Knowledge (Spark) is an independent, voluntary and non-profit organisation set up in 2000.
Our story:
In 1998, the ADHD Parent Support Group was set up by a parent of an ADHD child as a means of gathering and providing support for other parents going through similar pains and frustrations. The success achieved by the Support Group in fostering understanding and acceptance towards ADHD children led to the realisation that more had to be done to raise awareness of ADHD amongst educators and the general public. In response to this, Spark was formed by a number of parents from the Support Group to expand on the scope of work done previously.
Our objectives:

To create public awareness of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
To help families with ADHD children cope better with the disorder
To promote understanding and research on ADHD
