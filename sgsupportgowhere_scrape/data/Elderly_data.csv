Hey  You Got Mail ;"Hey  You Got Mail  is a student-led initiative dedicated to spreading joy and countering the effects of social isolation  especially among the elderly  through the creation and distribution of high-quality  handmade cards. This thoughtful endeavor invites individuals to send personalized cards to loved ones or communities they wish to support  fostering a sense of connection and warmth. The initiative goes beyond just card-making  it actively promotes volunteerism  encouraging participants to engage in a variety of creative activities  such as designing  drawing  and even dancing  to contribute to their noble cause.
In collaboration with schools  corporations  and other organizations  Hey  You Got Mail  orchestrates meaningful projects aimed at tackling the often overlooked issue of social isolation  an issue that has been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their efforts in reaching out to seniors are not limited to the joy brought by receiving a card but also serve as an engaging invitation for the elderly to partake in a range of activities alongside the younger generation. This integration of generations is realized through organized outings to scenic locations like the Botanic Gardens and participation in unique cultural experiences  such as kueh-making workshops.
By using card-making and distribution as a gateway  Hey  You Got Mail  not only delivers messages of love and support but also bridges the gap between the young and the old. This innovative approach fosters intergenerational relationships  encourages cultural exchange  and provides the elderly with opportunities to break out of isolation and engage in enriching experiences. Through these shared activities  the initiative cultivates a community spirit  encouraging inclusivity and understanding across different age groups  thereby making a significant impact on combating loneliness and social isolation.";https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource xCtyddQ3buB;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Hey  You Got Mail  admin@heyyougotmail.com Website;https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource xCtyddQ3buB
