Chen Su Lan Methodist Children s Home;Chen Su Lan Methodist Children s Home  CSLMCH  provides temporary shelter  care  and protection to boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 21 years old who come from needy and disadvantaged families in Singapore. Our Home is one of the biggest children s homes in Singapore.There are usually 70 - 90 boys and girls living in the Children s Home and every year  20 - 30 children are admitted or discharged back into their families or community.The ChildrenOur children come from different ethnic and religious backgrounds and different regions of Singapore. They are not orphans. The majority are from low income  broken  dysfunctional or abusive families whose parents cannot  will not or should not care for them. Broken families are usually single parents who are imprisoned or facing severe financial difficulties or health issues. Dysfunctional families are usually parents who have mental health issues  addictions or who have abandoned their children. Abusive families have seriously neglected or emotionally  sexually or physically abused their children  or failed to protect them  so their children have been removed by the courts and placed in our Home for their own protection. Some of our children also have special needs  ADHD  low IQ  and their parents cannot manage them.The children are referred to us by community partners like the Family Service Centers  the Ministry of Social and Family Development  MSF  or the Court  either on Compassionate Grounds  MSF Referred or by Court Order . We do not admit children directly and the decision to admit a child is always taken carefully. We only accept children between 5  amp  16 years old and only when there are no other family members or foster parents able to care for them.Some children stay in the Home for a couple of months  the majority  80   stay for 6 months to 5 years and some remain in the Home for their entire childhood. It all depends on their family situation.The Children s HomeOur mission is to provide loving  Christian nurture to needy and disadvantaged children of all races and religions so as to prepare them to be happy and responsible members of their family and community. The main Residential Home works to achieve this in 3 ways  nbsp Care - nbsp  We provide the children with shelter  care and protection. The Children s Home has a playground  a kitchen  a dining hall  a chapel  a large multipurpose hall and six houses where the children sleep  3 for the girls  amp  3 for the boys . The children live in the Home but they go to their former schools during the week. Our residential care and support staff ensure that they are protected  cared for and provided with everything they need 24 hours a day in the Home. nbsp Development - nbsp  We try to heal and develop the children. Many of the children are angry  ashamed  traumatised or dysfunctional due to their past experiences or family backgrounds. Some are so hurt  that they cannot self-regulate or understand their emotions. Our staff therefore practice Trauma Informed Care  a care structure that recognises  amp  seeks to heal children suffering from trauma   the most traumatised children are given professional counselling and therapy  our education manager monitors the academic progress of the children and recommends extra tuition when needed  our chaplain counsels and teaches the children about Jesus and Christian values  and our partners  sponsors and volunteers provide support  friendship and enrichment programmes to inspire the children and develop their interests  talents and self-confidence. nbsp Reunification - nbsp  We try to reunite the children back into their families as soon and safely as possible. Most of the boys and girls want to go back to their parents and CSLMCH believes that children are always better off living with their families than in a Children s Home. So our social workers help their families to solve their problems and encourage them to see their children as often as possible. And when the parents  or other family members  are able to care for them again  the children are discharged from the Children s Home and monitored for 2 years afterwards to ensure that the reunification process is safe and successful. Children who cannot be reunited with their families can stay in the Children s Home until they are 21 years old and have finished school  started working or gone into National Service or they can be put up for fostering. nbsp ;https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource pSTKAuHuX47;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"Chen Su Lan Methodist Children s Home     Leaflet   OneMap   contributors   Singapore Land Authority 202 Serangoon Garden Way

GSC was set up in 1986 to provide a safe place for women who have been abused or who suffer from seemingly insurmountable difficulties  to work through their trauma and crisis. Some of the women  often with children in tow  are survivors of chronic domestic violence. As far as possible  we accommodate the mothers and their children together in the shelter. Some of the abused spouses are foreigners with little family support and few friends they can turn to.

Through our care and compassion  and programmes and activities  the women experience healing and are empowered to tap on their inner strength and resources to rebuild their lives and plan a future for themselves and their families.

As earning an income is key to their independence  we help them to find a job. We are blessed with understanding and compassionate employers who believe in our mission and who partner with us to provide jobs for the women under our care. We also help the women in their search for a decent roof over their heads.

Open Home Network;"The Open Home Network encourages and enables Singaporeans to open up their homes as a place of respite for people-in-crisis  PICs .
We designed a system to match PICs with our list of host families  together with their social worker. It is a micro initiative with a big goal of spurring Singaporeans on to normalise and practice hospitality by befriending a stranger and letting them in.
The issue of homelessness is a prevailing yet well-hidden problem in Singapore. It goes beyond the physical need of having a roof over one s head to the compromising safety and well-being of the individual. 
3 main categories of homelessness include 

People who sleep in public spaces due to a lack of permanent housing and accommodation
People who reside in shelters and hostels due to housing eviction  etc
People who live in overcrowded houses  who face family violence  or lack social support.

If untaken care of  the issue of homelessness could hinder an individuals  sense of identity  security and belonging  impairing their physical and mental health.
When the community comes together to support someone in crisis  we are able to provide and care for those in need in a more holistic and sustainable manner. 
To build a network of care and support around such Persons-in-crisis  PICs . We envisioned a re-energized  kampung spirit  - neighbourliness in action  where resources get pooled together to help the needy in an organic manner. To do so  we came up with a framework consisting of host families  community representatives  case managers  social workers and our beneficiaries - the PICs. We created an Open Home Toolkit to equip host families to better engage and care for themselves during their time hosting. We then called for host families to open up their homes and matched them according to the needs of our PIC referrals. Follow-ups and regular check-ins were conducted to ensure the well-being of both host family and PIC.";https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource btKfwwfpbn2;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"OHN     Leaflet   OneMap   contributors   Singapore Land Authority 24 Sin Ming Lane
