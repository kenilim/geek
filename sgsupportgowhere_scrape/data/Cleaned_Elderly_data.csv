Hey You Got Mail;"Hey You Got Mail is a studentled initiative dedicated to spreading joy and countering the effects of social isolation especially among the elderly through the creation and distribution of highquality handmade cards. This thoughtful endeavor invites individuals to send personalized cards to loved ones or communities they wish to support fostering a sense of connection and warmth. The initiative goes beyond just cardmaking it actively promotes volunteerism encouraging participants to engage in a variety of creative activities such as designing drawing and even dancing to contribute to their noble cause.
In collaboration with schools corporations and other organizations Hey You Got Mail orchestrates meaningful projects aimed at tackling the often overlooked issue of social isolation an issue that has been intensified by the COVID19 pandemic. Their efforts in reaching out to seniors are not limited to the joy brought by receiving a card but also serve as an engaging invitation for the elderly to partake in a range of activities alongside the younger generation. This integration of generations is realized through organized outings to scenic locations like the Botanic Gardens and participation in unique cultural experiences such as kuehmaking workshops.
By using cardmaking and distribution as a gateway Hey You Got Mail not only delivers messages of love and support but also bridges the gap between the young and the old. This innovative approach fosters intergenerational relationships encourages cultural exchange and provides the elderly with opportunities to break out of isolation and engage in enriching experiences. Through these shared activities the initiative cultivates a community spirit encouraging inclusivity and understanding across different age groups thereby making a significant impact on combating loneliness and social isolation.";httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcexCtyddQ3buB;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Hey You Got Mail admin@heyyougotmail.com Website;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcexCtyddQ3buB
