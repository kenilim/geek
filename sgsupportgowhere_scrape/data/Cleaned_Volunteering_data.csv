NCIS Dream Makers;"About the NCIS Dream Makers
At the National University Cancer Institute Singapore NCIS we see about 600 latestage adult cancer patients every year and the number has been increasing. When faced with potential terminal cancers many patients may have unfulfilled dreams that are important to them and their families. As most wishgranting organisations are focused on helping children our goal is to fill in the gap and help adult cancer patients achieve their dreams as well. 
Thus in conjunction with the NCIS 10th Year Anniversary in 2018 we launched the NCIS Dream Makers a new initiative to help NCIS patients with advanced cancers fulfill their dreams. Our goal is to help our advanced cancer patients fulfill their dreams and give hope and encouragement towards their cancer journey. This also gives us an opportunity to improve their quality of lives beyond just clinical care. 
We listen to our patients dreams and we want to help make them come true. Through the NCIS Dream Makers we want our patients to know that there is life beyond cancer and add some cheer and positivity to their fight with cancer
Who Are the NCIS Dream Makers
The NCIS Dream Makers are made up of NCIS staff and a group of volunteers comprising doctors healthcare professionals NGOs corporate bodies and ordinary people from all walks of lives who are passionate in helping our patients achieve their dreams. We are guided by the firm belief that by helping others we discover the meaning of caring and togetherness that will bring out fulfilment in our own lives.
