Catholic Aids Response Effort;It all began when Anne Webb was asked to visit and pray with an AIDS patient at the Communicable Disease Centre CDC. The bedridden patient was partially blind and wanted somebody to pray with him. In those days and to some extent even now PLWHAs were shunned by an AIDSphobic public. Her daughter Jackie Webb later took over her role when she was unable to carry on her prayer ministry.Jackie went on to form CARE in 1991.nbspReadnbspJackie Webbs account of our beginnings in her 2004 letter addressed to past President Michael Png.We were inaugurated as a lay apostolate ministry of the Catholic Church on 6 June 1992 with the approval of His Grace Archbishop Emeritus Gregory Yong.For a picture of what we were doing 10 years later clicknbspherenbspto read the historic description taken from the first CARE website.In the first ten years we did ward work. However this had to cease with the onset of SARS in 2002. From then on we switched our efforts to caring for the homeless and the destitute who were not hospitalised. After a number of temporary locations we established the first CARE Shelter at 11 Hillside Drive the former premises of St Josephs Convent in 2005. We then moved to 43 Toa Payoh Rise with the kind permission of the Good Shepherd Sisters in 2006.In 2014 we moved to our existing premises when the land at Toa Payoh Rise was acquired by the government for national development.In 2008 we initiated our NonResident Support Programme targeting at PLWHA women and their children. In the same year we started our Schools Outreach programme initially targeting Catholic secondary schools.Following a strategic review in 2009 in 2010 we initiated a Befrienders Programme aimed at providing a structured framework within which Volunteers may befriend and help our resident and nonresident PLWHAs and eventually those in our Follow Up programme. We also adopted Advocacy as a major thrust of our work to help create better understanding compassion and acceptance of PLWHAs by families employers and society.We were registered as a society in 2004 and a charity in 2006.

Muscular Dystrophy Association;"ABOUT MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY
Muscular Dystrophy is an umbrella term used to refer to a group of muscular disorders characterised by muscle weakness wasting and contractures which are usually progressive in nature and sometimes even life threatening. These disorders result from inherited gene abnormalities.

While most of these disorders manifest in childhood some may have an adult onset. The severity of the symptoms the age at which the symptoms appear how fast the individual deteriorates and the pattern of inheritance the disorder follows vary from one form of Muscular Dystrophy to another.

Over time persons with Muscular Dystrophy may lose the ability to walk and ultimately breathe. For some individuals the disorder is lifethreatening. At present there is no known cure for Muscular Dystrophy.

Society for Continence Singapore;"Origins
The Society for Continence Singapore SFCS originated from the dedicated efforts of a group of doctors nurses and rehabilitation therapists who recognised the special needs of the incontinent as far back as 1988. Among the pioneering group of people to be mentioned are Dr Anne Merriman Dr Rilly Ray and Prof Peter Lim Huat Chye. In 1988 a symposium on the Management of Urinary Incontinence was held for the first time in Singapore for all healthcare professionals to address this growing malady.
The enthusiasm shown by medical professionals in treating incontinent patients prompted Prof Peter Lim Huat Chye a Consultant Urologist to form an organisation to look into this subspecialty. SFCS was officially set up in Toa Payoh Hospital as a voluntary welfare organisation registered with the Singapore government in 1991.
