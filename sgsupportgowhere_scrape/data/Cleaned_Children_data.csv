Elevate the Streets;"Elevate the Streets is an initiative that aims to bridge street subcultures with social services through workshops events and outreach.
On 10th March 2019 some of us gathered in a cozy apartment and we had a crazy idea. We wanted to apply our common love for breaking to serving a greater cause. Our central idea was simple breaking had empowered us and can similarly empower others.
Troubled and disaffected youths often benefit from having an anchor in their formative years to channel their energies productively. This led us to explore breaking as a way to reach out to youth communities. In fact this concept of reaching out through hiphop is a core part of the culture tied in with its wellknown elements of Peace Love Unity and Having Fun.
With these thoughts and convictions we started a movement that championed all that is positive about being involved in subcultures  the community the values and the potential for social impact. Through Elevate the Streets we hope to become a gateway where outsiders can have an enriched understanding of what it means to practice bboying djing graffiti parkour and other subcultures in Singapore.";httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresource3pQPhg5E5Zz;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;They can be contacted through form in their website;Elevate the Streets elevatethestreets@gmail.com Website;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresource3pQPhg5E5Zz

Kids Weekday Care  YWCA;"Supporting Underprivileged Children
Replacing the former Kids Club programme which ran from 2007 to 2015 the YWCA Kids Weekday Care KWC programme was set up in 2016 to provide afterschool care to latchkey children from lowincome families. It was created in response to demand for afterschool care needs from our beneficiary families under our MealsonWheels httpsywca.org.sgfooddistributionmealsonwheels programme.
The thriceweekly afterschool care service covers twoway transport from school and back to their respective homes halal lunch and a structured care schedule at a highly subsidised cost.
The care programme aims to provide social emotional moral and academic support to disadvantaged children by creating a rewarding and conducive environment for them to develop their selfworth and character discover their unique potential and strive for excellence. In doing so it perpetuates YWCAs endeavours to offer a more holistic approach to helping children from lowincome families under the MealsonWheels programme and those who are referred by schools.
The Kids Weekday Care focuses on the overall development of children through a broad range of activities such as tutoring mentorship enrichment soft skills and life skills workshops outings and group work. Service and valuebased learning is emphasized as well as work in alliance with parents. Casework and counselling will be available for children who require it.
