Community Shop 善粮小铺 (Food From The Heart),"The Community Shop (善粮小铺) is a giving better initiative by Food from the Heart for its beneficiaries in Singapore. The Community Shop functions as a mini-mart for beneficiaries and operates on a shop-for-free concept. 
Food from the Heart's beneficiaries are empowered to choose 14 food items from the Community Shop each month, and can visit the Shop on multiple occasions throughout the month. Food items include fresh local produce, staples, canned food, bread spreads, biscuits, oil and condiments, all of which will allow beneficiaries to eat better.
The food items are redeemed through the beneficiaries' cards via a QR code-scanning checkout system.
The Community Shop is one of Food from the Heart's milestone initiatives that strives to give better by returning the dignity of choice to the needy; at the Shop, they are able to choose food items that they require instead of receiving standard food packages. This mental aspect helps to close the increasing gap in Singapore's standards of living; the experience of shopping allows them to see the range of products available at the Shop, compare them, and choose what they want to bring home.
The Shop gives the beneficiaries a reason to get out of their homes to have more interaction with others, creating opportunities for the community to look out for one another. Its food drop, which allows donors to drop off food donations at the Shop, also helps to keep the kampung spirit alive within the neighbourhood.
The Community Shop concept also results in less food waste as the beneficiaries are likely to finish all the items they chose themselves. 
Through the QR code-scanning checkout system, Food from the Heart is able to digitally gather data on the consumption, needs and patterns of its beneficiaries. With such insights, a more meaningful and nuanced understanding of beneficiaries' dietary habits will also help us shape the future landscape in food distribution efforts. We hope to create an entire eco-system connecting donors, sponsors, volunteers and beneficiaries.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/sWKBrQCgcQH,No Content Found,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,"Community Shop @ Boon Lay + − Leaflet | OneMap © contributors | Singapore Land Authority Blk 176 Boon Lay Drive #01-366

Project Belanja! 热食暖心齐买单 (Food From The Heart),"Project Belanja! (热食暖心齐买单) is Food from the Heart’s app-driven hot food redemption programme, run in partnership with hawker stall owners. The programme provides needy with freshly-cooked meals to be redeemed at designated neighbouring hawker stalls, within proximity of the activity zones of the beneficiaries.
Some of our beneficiaries are unable to cook their own meals. To them, Project Belanja! is a cooked-food alternative to food pack rations like those from the Community Food Pack programme.
To others, it gives them greater choice and flexibility over what their meal will be - they get to choose when they want a change from their usual fare, cooked by someone else in a different way, enjoyed in another environment.
The programme also encourages them to step out of the house to interact with the community.
Redemption Process
Beneficiaries use the QR code on their Food from the Heart beneficiary card to redeem meals for up to 15 meals per month for each person. The cards are scanned on a mobile app used by partnering hawker stall vendors, where redemption data is tracked to better understand and serve the beneficiaries.
Find out more about our Community Shop, another digitalised food-redemption project by Food from the Heart.
