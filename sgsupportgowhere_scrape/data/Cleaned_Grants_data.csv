Maybank Momentum Grant The Majurity Trust;"The Maybank Momentum Grant seeks to propel promising charities forward by investing in the transformation of their operations so that they can run sustainably and to build the right momentum to thrive.
Postpandemic recovery has been challenging for all businesses and charities are struck especially hard. 
Charities like businesses require capital to invest in organisational growth. However funding in the sector is primarily restricted towards programmes rather than manpower.
In such environments smaller charities struggle the most as they typically operate with lean inhouse capabilities and small reserves. Their leaders face an uphill battle in the postpandemic business environment of employee burnout and donor and volunteer fatigue.
The Maybank Momentum Grant is designed to provide flexible funding so that smaller charities can invest in their teams thereby extending their bandwidth to focus on longterm strategic plans.";httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcegmZK3BqmFWD;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"RECYCLABLE GRANT Maybank Momentum Grant will help small charities including nonIPC charities tide through the mediumterm by providing a interestfree recyclable grant equivalent to 4 months of operating expenditure capped at 150000. By recycling the grant it enables TMT to channel support to more charities in need multiplying the impact of the fund.
CAPACITY BUILDING Besides capital support it will also provide initial capability building for charities to kickstart their transformation efforts. We will do this through strategy masterclasses and 11 consultation sessions to help charities serve better and build stronger sustainability.

In partnership with GIC it has now evolved to become Singapores first Groundup Leader Fellowship  investing in outstanding community leaders to deliver systemslevel change.
When Covid19 hit our shores The Majurity Trust with the support of Singaporebased family foundations philanthropists and corporate partners launched the SG Strong Fund in 2020 as a crisis response fund. It was the start of challenging times for Singapore. But the unprecedented difficulties compelled us to do more for groundup initiatives that rose up to face the challenges headon. 10 donors rallied together with 550000 to launch the fund.
In 2021 as the situation stabilised we turned our efforts to focus on recovery from the crisis. With support from the Community Foundation of Singapore we launched Groundup@Sg as a second phase of SG Strong supporting groundup initiatives that were helping to build more resilient communities on the ground.
The COVID19 situation continues to evolve today. The fear that gripped us at the start of the crisis has given way to a new normal as our society adjusts and copes. Despite the unprecedented difficulties we have been facing we continue to see an overwhelming outpouring of kindness strength and resilience in our community. We are humbled and encouraged by the opportunity that The Majurity Trust has been given to support and enable the groundup initiatives to do good.
As we move forward we remain certain that a flourishing groundup ecosystem is key to a resilient and crisisready Singapore with community activators leading the way.

The Scaffold Fund The Majurity Trust;"During the Covid19 outbreak in foreign worker dormitories many Singaporeans expressed deep concern regarding the poor treatment and living conditions of lowwage migrant workers residing in purposebuilt dormitories. Some called on the Government to relook policies others pressured companies to provide better benefits to the workers.
However amid all the debate and discussion about improving the welfare of migrant workers what is becoming clear is that there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to this multifaceted issue. Government and corporate policies must change but the community also needs to respond by shifting its mindset towards lowwage migrant workers.
In sum the goal of bettering the lives of the 350000 migrant workers in this city will require society as a whole to commit to collective ownership and action.";httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcewnwcFL5AchH;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;The Scaffold Fund Website;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcewnwcFL5AchH
