Food from the Hearts beneficiaries are empowered to choose 14 food items from the Community Shop each month and can visit the Shop on multiple occasions throughout the month. Food items include fresh local produce staples canned food bread spreads biscuits oil and condiments all of which will allow beneficiaries to eat better.
The food items are redeemed through the beneficiaries cards via a QR codescanning checkout system.
The Community Shop is one of Food from the Hearts milestone initiatives that strives to give better by returning the dignity of choice to the needy at the Shop they are able to choose food items that they require instead of receiving standard food packages. This mental aspect helps to close the increasing gap in Singapores standards of living the experience of shopping allows them to see the range of products available at the Shop compare them and choose what they want to bring home.
The Shop gives the beneficiaries a reason to get out of their homes to have more interaction with others creating opportunities for the community to look out for one another. Its food drop which allows donors to drop off food donations at the Shop also helps to keep the kampung spirit alive within the neighbourhood.
The Community Shop concept also results in less food waste as the beneficiaries are likely to finish all the items they chose themselves. 
Through the QR codescanning checkout system Food from the Heart is able to digitally gather data on the consumption needs and patterns of its beneficiaries. With such insights a more meaningful and nuanced understanding of beneficiaries dietary habits will also help us shape the future landscape in food distribution efforts.
