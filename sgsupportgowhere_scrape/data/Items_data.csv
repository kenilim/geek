Play It Forward;"Public pianos around Singapore for all to play 
Play it Forward Singapore is a homegrown public piano movement launched by three piano nerds in September 2015.
The idea first came about when we heard about the large number of old pianos being thrown away every year. Many people we know love to play the piano  but stopped doing so for various reasons. Hundreds of neglected pianos are gathering dust in homes across Singapore right now. At the same time  there are some among us who cannot afford to own a piano or do not have access to this instrument. 
So we thought  why not rescue these unwanted instruments and share them with everyone  
We wanted people to love playing music again  so we decided to place these pianos in public spaces as public instruments that anyone can play on anytime. But what if these pianos can look interesting too   We collaborated with local artists and designers to transform old pianos into public art pieces  while remaining as functional instruments that are a joy to play on.
As musicians ourselves  we are particular about the sound quality of the old pianos and will do everything we can to make sure that everyone enjoys playing on them in a location with good acoustics. We hire professionals to tune all our public pianos  and sometimes we ourselves give it a go at repairing the hammers and strings 
Till today  we have restored more than 20 pianos into public art installations which were donated to needy beneficiaries after the public run. Our public pianos have since traveled to more than 16 locations in the city and played by thousands of people since.
We have seen people whose faces lit up with a smile when a friend sits down to play a tune  musicians who now have a place to practise and perform  urban spaces transformed into places for interaction and bonding  and numerous videos of beautiful performances on the street by musicians and curious onlookers. It makes our day when we see people gathering around the pianos and enjoying the music in the Singapore city.
We have successfully completed our fourth edition of public pianos in the city and preparing for our latest edition commencing in August 2017. Check out more about the pianos here. Play It Forward Singapore was commended by the Ministry of Culture  Community  Youth and Sports  MCCY   Our Singapore  campaign as one of the  ideas that are changing Singapore  in 2016.
We cannot wait to do more and bring together more people in this movement of giving  collaborating and sharing the joy of music in our lion city.";https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource GQJPr4YRcvu;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Play It Forward sg.playitforward@gmail.com Website;https   www.sgsocialsupport.com resource GQJPr4YRcvu
