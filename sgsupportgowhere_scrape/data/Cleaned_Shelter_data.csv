Chen Su Lan Methodist Childrens Home;Chen Su Lan Methodist Childrens Home CSLMCH provides temporary shelter care and protection to boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 21 years old who come from needy and disadvantaged families in Singapore. Our Home is one of the biggest childrens homes in Singapore.There are usually 70  90 boys and girls living in the Childrens Home and every year 20  30 children are admitted or discharged back into their families or community.The ChildrenOur children come from different ethnic and religious backgrounds and different regions of Singapore. They are not orphans. The majority are from low income broken dysfunctional or abusive families whose parents cannot will not or should not care for them. Broken families are usually single parents who are imprisoned or facing severe financial difficulties or health issues. Dysfunctional families are usually parents who have mental health issues addictions or who have abandoned their children. Abusive families have seriously neglected or emotionally sexually or physically abused their children or failed to protect them so their children have been removed by the courts and placed in our Home for their own protection. Some of our children also have special needs ADHD low IQ and their parents cannot manage them.The children are referred to us by community partners like the Family Service Centers the Ministry of Social and Family Development MSF or the Court either on Compassionate Grounds MSF Referred or by Court Order. We do not admit children directly and the decision to admit a child is always taken carefully. We only accept children between 5 amp 16 years old and only when there are no other family members or foster parents able to care for them.Some children stay in the Home for a couple of months the majority 80 stay for 6 months to 5 years and some remain in the Home for their entire childhood. It all depends on their family situation.The Childrens HomeOur mission is to provide loving Christian nurture to needy and disadvantaged children of all races and religions so as to prepare them to be happy and responsible members of their family and community. The main Residential Home works to achieve this in 3 waysnbspCare nbsp We provide the children with shelter care and protection. The Childrens Home has a playground a kitchen a dining hall a chapel a large multipurpose hall and six houses where the children sleep 3 for the girls amp 3 for the boys. The children live in the Home but they go to their former schools during the week. Our residential care and support staff ensure that they are protected cared for and provided with everything they need 24 hours a day in the Home.nbspDevelopment nbsp We try to heal and develop the children. Many of the children are angry ashamed traumatised or dysfunctional due to their past experiences or family backgrounds. Some are so hurt that they cannot selfregulate or understand their emotions. Our staff therefore practice Trauma Informed Care a care structure that recognises amp seeks to heal children suffering from trauma the most traumatised children are given professional counselling and therapy our education manager monitors the academic progress of the children and recommends extra tuition when needed our chaplain counsels and teaches the children about Jesus and Christian values and our partners sponsors and volunteers provide support friendship and enrichment programmes to inspire the children and develop their interests talents and selfconfidence.nbspReunification nbsp We try to reunite the children back into their families as soon and safely as possible. Most of the boys and girls want to go back to their parents and CSLMCH believes that children are always better off living with their families than in a Childrens Home. So our social workers help their families to solve their problems and encourage them to see their children as often as possible. And when the parents or other family members are able to care for them again the children are discharged from the Childrens Home and monitored for 2 years afterwards to ensure that the reunification process is safe and successful. Children who cannot be reunited with their families can stay in the Childrens Home until they are 21 years old and have finished school started working or gone into National Service or they can be put up for fostering.nbsp;httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcepSTKAuHuX47;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"Chen Su Lan Methodist Childrens Home   Leaflet  OneMap  contributors  Singapore Land Authority 202 Serangoon Garden Way

Good Shepherd Centre Marymount Centre;"A Safe Sanctuary

GSC was set up in 1986 to provide a safe place for women who have been abused or who suffer from seemingly insurmountable difficulties to work through their trauma and crisis. Some of the women often with children in tow are survivors of chronic domestic violence. As far as possible we accommodate the mothers and their children together in the shelter. Some of the abused spouses are foreigners with little family support and few friends they can turn to.

Through our care and compassion and programmes and activities the women experience healing and are empowered to tap on their inner strength and resources to rebuild their lives and plan a future for themselves and their families.

As earning an income is key to their independence we help them to find a job. We are blessed with understanding and compassionate employers who believe in our mission and who partner with us to provide jobs for the women under our care. We also help the women in their search for a decent roof over their heads.

The issue of homelessness is a prevailing yet wellhidden problem in Singapore. It goes beyond the physical need of having a roof over ones head to the compromising safety and wellbeing of the individual. 
3 main categories of homelessness include

People who sleep in public spaces due to a lack of permanent housing and accommodation
People who reside in shelters and hostels due to housing eviction etc
People who live in overcrowded houses who face family violence or lack social support.

If untaken care of the issue of homelessness could hinder an individuals sense of identity security and belonging impairing their physical and mental health.
When the community comes together to support someone in crisis we are able to provide and care for those in need in a more holistic and sustainable manner. 
To build a network of care and support around such Personsincrisis PICs. We envisioned a reenergized kampung spirit  neighbourliness in action where resources get pooled together to help the needy in an organic manner. To do so we came up with a framework consisting of host families community representatives case managers social workers and our beneficiaries  the PICs. We created an Open Home Toolkit to equip host families to better engage and care for themselves during their time hosting. We then called for host families to open up their homes and matched them according to the needs of our PIC referrals. Followups and regular checkins were conducted to ensure the wellbeing of both host family and PIC.";httpswww.sgsocialsupport.comresourcebtKfwwfpbn2;No Content Found;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;"OHN   Leaflet  OneMap  contributors  Singapore Land Authority 24 Sin Ming Lane

Transit Point @ Margaret Drive New Hope Community Services;Years of engaging with rough sleepers on the ground and our continued partnership with the MSF PEERS Network taught us that there is a need for a lowentry communitybased interim shelter to serve rough sleepers with complex housing needs.With the support of MSF we secured the site of the former Queenstown Polyclinic at 51 Margaret Drive to provide an interim shelter for rough sleepers named Transit Point @ Margaret Drive. Its first hundreds of residents were male and female rough sleepers as well as displaced persons affected by the Malaysian Government Movement Control Order.Initially a selffunded shelter which started during the early phase of the Covid19 pandemic TP@MD obtained subsequent funding support from the National Council of Social Services and the Singapore Totalisator Board in May 2020. TP@MD was also built on the generosity of various community partners and donors who contributed all kinds of tangible and intangible support. To us this further exemplified the importance of community in uplifting the lives of the displaced and disadvantaged.Our team at the shelter actively works with residents to facilitate their interim and long term housing goals empower them with the requisite skills needed to achieve selfreliance and connect them to relevant social resources to meet their holistic needs.
