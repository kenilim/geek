Elevate the Streets;"Elevate the Streets is an initiative that aims to bridge street subcultures with social services through workshops  events and outreach.
On 10th March 2019  some of us gathered in a cozy apartment  and we had a crazy idea. We wanted to apply our common love for breaking to serving a greater cause. Our central idea was simple  breaking had empowered us  and can similarly empower others.
Troubled and disaffected youths often benefit from having an anchor in their formative years to channel their energies productively. This led us to explore breaking as a way to reach out to youth communities. In fact  this concept of reaching out through hip hop is a core part of the culture  tied in with its well known elements of  Peace  Love  Unity and Having Fun .
With these thoughts and convictions  we started a movement that championed all that is positive about being involved in subcultures   the community  the values  and the potential for social impact. Through Elevate the Streets  we hope to become a gateway where outsiders can have an enriched understanding of what it means to practice b boying  dj ing  graffiti  parkour  and other subcultures in Singapore.";https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/3pQPhg5E5Zz;N/A;https   elevatethestreets.com;Please contact the organisation for more details.;Please contact the organisation for more details.;They can be contacted through form in their website
