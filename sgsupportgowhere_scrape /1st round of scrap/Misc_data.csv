Lakeside Integrated Service Provider Programmes,"Lakeside was appointed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development to run Integrated Service Provider (ISP) programmes. Through case management, counselling, and groupwork, youth offenders and youths-at-risk learn from their mistakes and gain awareness, knowledge, and life skills needed to avoid getting into similar risky situations in the future. Our programmes and services include:

Guidance Programme (GP) is a 6- to 12-month programme for youths who have committed minor offences or have low levels of involvement in offences. We help youths make the right choices to lead a crime-free lifestyle and recognise offenses as criminal acts. We teach youths prosocial ways of solving problems and conflicts, assist them in being meaningfully engaged with school or work, and support them in forming healthy relationships.
Streetwise Programme (SWP) is a 6-month programme for youths who associate with gangs. We help youths dissociate from gangs and improve their family relationships. We equip youths with life skills like emotional &amp; conflict management, and awareness of their actions. We also equip parents with parenting skills.
As part of Triage, we assist police in investigations by conducting interviews with young offenders. Our goal is to divert young offenders from the criminal justice system. We refer families with social or financial issues to community resources, and recommend appropriate intervention that addresses the needs of young offenders.
Enhanced Step-Up (ESU) is a 12-month programme for students at risk of dropping out and out-of-school youths. We help youths return to school or find employment.
We provide family intervention, career guidance, life skills training, and financial assistance referrals.
Post Care is our programme following up with youths who have completed ISP programmes. Our aim is to help them maintain the good progress they have made. We provide emotional support and advice for youths, introduce them to community activities and career guidance, and provide referrals to other agencies for counselling and vocational programmes.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/JSjwFDsFU-D,No Content Found,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,"Contact:

Ronald McDonald House @ NUH (Ronald McDonald House Charities),"Established and opened in January 2013, our Ronald McDonald House programme provides a place of respite for families, allowing them to be close to their hospitalised child at no cost.
Many families travel far from home to get treatment for their seriously ill children. Often, it can be a long time away from home, and family. For children facing a serious medical crisis, nothing seems scarier than not having their mom and dad close by for love and support. The Ronald McDonald House allows families to be steps away while their children are receiving treatment at NUH. Situated near the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, the RMH is approximately 126 square meters of space. It has four ensuite bedrooms, a reading room, living room, dining room, laundry area and kitchenette.
Our Ronald McDonald House is staffed 24 hours, seven days a week, and offers a place to call home at no cost so families can afford the best care for their children.
In order to continue caring for their sick children, caregivers need to prioritise their wellbeing and keep themselves healthy and nothing beats a hearty meal after a long day of caregiving. For the convenience of our families, we now also provide ready-to-eat meals twice a week.
The 4-bedroom House has been able to serve over 930 families, or over 11,000 room nights.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/qfWe9SEfTUT,No Content Found,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,"Ronald McDonald House Charities + − Leaflet | OneMap © contributors | Singapore Land Authority 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road
