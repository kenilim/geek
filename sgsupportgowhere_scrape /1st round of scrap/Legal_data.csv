Community Justice Centre,"A large number of court users appearing before the State Courts are not represented by lawyers. Equipped with little or no legal knowledge, Litigants-in-Person (LiPs) often perceive the legal system as intimidating and therefore lack the confidence to conduct their cases, frequently struggling to have their “voices” heard in the courtroom. Without assistance to navigate through the legal and judicial processes, it is possible that some of them within this group may be at a disadvantage. Justice may not be seen to be done if LiPs are unable to effectively understand and participate in the legal process. They may feel that they are not given fair hearings or are unjustly deprived of their rights.
By being the nucleus of this new socio-legal approach is to ensure that the justice system remains accessible to all, regardless of status or race.
