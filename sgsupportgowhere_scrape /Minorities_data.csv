FareGo (TWC2),"Unable to work, injured workers often find themselves with a financial problem in addition to their worries over recovery. In theory, they are entitled to salary or medical leave wages (if the doctor has prescribed medical leave), but in reality, bureaucratic or other reasons often mean payment is badly delayed. Moreover, because of their low salaries, they have no savings. Virtually broke, injured workers find that they do not even have the means to pay for transport to the hospital for their medical appointments or physiotherapy.&nbsp; They simply don’t have money for transport.TWC2’s FareGo programme provides small sums to injured workers so that they can top up their transport fare cards. Strict qualifying criteria are applied: Applicants must be able to demonstrate that they are not allowed to work, that they have an upcoming medical appointment and that a stipulated exclusion period (since the last top-up) has passed.Although at an individual level, the subsidies provided are small, the total amount adds up to over $30,000 annually since there are so many workers in need.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/ZFWzNeAPfhT,No Content Found,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,"FareGo (TWC2) + − Leaflet | OneMap © contributors | Singapore Land Authority 180B Bencoolen Street #09-01

Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics,"Founded in 2004 by the late Ms Bridget Tan, HOME (Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics) is dedicated to supporting and empowering migrant workers who experience abuse and exploitation. Three pillars guide us: Welfare, Empowerment and Advocacy. We work with corporations, government agencies and community partners to promote inclusion, justice, equality and dignity for all.WelfareHelpdesk&nbsp;HOME operates a number of specialised helpdesks for all migrant workers seeking assistance. Our team of trained caseworkers and volunteers offer advice to workers unsure of their rights and options. Additionally HOME can assist with managing the end-to-end process of workers’ cases, supporting them to seek recourse, whether that be legal, medical, financial or psychological.Shelter HOME offers a place of refuge and social support for all vulnerable domestic workers. Many of our residents have experienced abuse and exploitation, and a number are in the process of seeking legal recourse or resolving disputes with their employers. With space for around 50 workers at any one time, the shelter residents may stay for periods of a few days to over a year, depending on the speed in which their cases are processed. In many instances, HOME’s shelter is their only place of sanctuary at a time when many have no way to support themselves, nor anywhere to stay in Singapore during their period of crisis. We seek to restore their dignity through holistic programmes and provide a variety of activities and services, from English classes to counselling sessions.Medical Treatment HOME offers subsidised dental services and outpatient treatment for our shelter residents.Legal AidHOME provides free legal aid for workers in Singapore and continues to assist them on return to their country of origin.EmpowermentHOME Academy With the aim of empowering domestic workers in Singapore, HOME Academy offers a variety of educational and vocational training programmes. Courses include English language, computer literacy, cooking, cosmetology, baking, caregiving, dressmaking, and financial literacy. Many of our courses are run by volunteer domestic workers with specialised skills and a passion for empowering others.AdvocacyHOME is a leading proponent of migrant workers’ rights in Singapore and aims to increase awareness of their situation through public education and campaigns on issues affecting the migrant worker population. Through our advocacy work we hope to help bring about changes to improve the lives of migrant workers in Singapore.HOME seeks to gain greater insight into the lives of migrant workers and the issues that affect them and we carry out research projects into the employment and living conditions of migrant workers in Singapore. Find out more here.ImpactOur helpdesks provide employment advice, legal aid, financial assistance, and medical services to approximately 2,000 workers every year. At the HOME Shelter, we house an average of 700 migrant domestic workers who are victims of abuse and exploitation. An additional 1,600 women, on average, attend our skills training courses every year.Our role in advocacy has led to changes to laws and policies in Singapore, such as the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, the Employment Act, Foreign Employees Dormitory Act, and the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act.

Medical Care (TWC2),"In a typical year, the largest of our Care Fund programmes goes to providing medical care. Whilst the law obliges employers to purchase insurance and thereby provide medical care, the law also sets out maximum limits to this obligation. There is a cap on how much medical costs need be borne by employers for injuries or illnesses. The cap is not unrealistic — in the main, almost all cases would not require more medical care than permitted by the cap.Invariably however, there will be outliers. These would be workers who have suffered such severe injures, necessitating major brain surgery or reconstructive surgery, for example, that costs far exceed the amount employers are obliged to pay for. From time to time too, workers come down with illnesses that may require long stays in hospitals or complex treatment, again beyond the legal cap.Some employers go well beyond their legal obligation, picking up the tab for extra medical care. Others do not. And that’s where TWC2 has to come in, on a humanitarian basis to ensure that the ill or injured worker does not see his treatment truncated and his suffering prolonged.TWC2 weighs each case very carefully. High priority is given to cases where surgery or medical treatment has a high chance of restoring the patient to an active working life so that he or she can continue to be a breadwinner. Where the prognosis is poor, we scale our support accordingly.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/w3kaMayrxnQ,No Content Found,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,"Medical Care (TWC2) + − Leaflet | OneMap © contributors | Singapore Land Authority 180B Bencoolen Street #09-01

Project Roof (TWC2),"Under the law, employers are required to continue to house their former employees till their cases are concluded and they go home or they have found a new job. In reality, workers — in the hundreds and maybe thousands — find it impossible to stay on in company quarters. They report a climate of intimidation and constant fear that the company would send in strong-armed repatriation agents in the middle of the night, seizing them and bundling them off to the airport against their will. These fears are not unfounded. TWC2 has heard many first-hand reports of such repatriation tactics. In any event, it is entirely conceivable that some companies may try all means to avoid the cost of housing their workers by making it difficult for them to stay on.Workers who flee company accommodation may borrow money from friends and relatives to rent a bunk space. But there are some with neither willing friends or relatives in Singapore.Project Roof helps subsidise their rent. The men find their own accommodation — typically a bunk in a crowded tenement in Little India — and, subject to eligibility criteria and financial limits set out in our programme, we help pay for it.It goes without saying that there are far more workers in need of such assistance than we can provide. Consequently, we apply strict criteria, chief of which is the severity of a worker’s &nbsp;injury. Top of the queue would be those who have recently had major surgery, or have suffered a serious injury compromising his mobility and ability to help himself.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/47P26jWPLGU,No Content Found,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,Please contact the organisation for more details.,"Project Roof (TWC2) + − Leaflet | OneMap © contributors | Singapore Land Authority 180B Bencoolen Street #09-01
