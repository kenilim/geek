The establishment of the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (the ""Fund"") was announced by Mr Lee Kuan Yew on 28 November, 2011, at the launch of his new book, “My Lifelong Challenge: Singapore’s Bilingual Journey”.

Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. Learning English and the Mother Tongue Languages helps prepare our children to plug into a globalised world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage.
The Fund has been set up to supplement efforts by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the teaching and learning of English and the Mother Tongue Languages.
What the Fund Does
Our MTL, heritage and culture forms an integral part of Singapore's identity and asset. The Fund supports proposals that encourage bilingualism and the learning of our MTLs as living languages and a lifelong endeavour.",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/gC-T5EkEzAC,No Content Found,"The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism invites you to submit proposals to promote bilingualism.

Research has shown that exposure in early years is effective for nurturing bilingualism and the learning of multiple languages. Strengthening our efforts to encourage bilingualism in the early years, especially in listening and speaking capabilities, would provide our children with a headstart in language acquisition and lay a stronger foundation for bilingual learning in their later years. The Fund has set specific periods for Call for Proposals (CFP) in January and July each year. Proposals that are received outside of the CFP period will only be evaluated during the next CFP.

SGStrong (The Majurity Trust),"SG Strong started as a crisis response fund during Covid pandemic in 2020 to support groundup initiatives.
In partnership with GIC, it has now evolved to become Singapore’s first Groundup Leader Fellowship - investing in outstanding community leaders to deliver systems-level change.
When Covid-19 hit our shores, The Majurity Trust with the support of Singapore-based family foundations, philanthropists and corporate partners launched the SG Strong Fund in 2020 as a crisis response fund. It was the start of challenging times for Singapore. But the unprecedented difficulties compelled us to do more for groundup initiatives that rose up to face the challenges head-on. 10 donors rallied together with $550,000 to launch the fund.
In 2021, as the situation stabilised, we turned our efforts to focus on recovery from the crisis. With support from the Community Foundation of Singapore, we launched Groundup@Sg as a second phase of SG Strong, supporting groundup initiatives that were helping to build more resilient communities on the ground.
The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve today. The fear that gripped us at the start of the crisis has given way to a new normal as our society adjusts and copes. Despite the unprecedented difficulties we have been facing, we continue to see an overwhelming outpouring of kindness, strength and resilience in our community. We are humbled and encouraged by the opportunity that The Majurity Trust has been given to support and enable the groundup initiatives to do good.
As we move forward, we remain certain that a flourishing groundup ecosystem is key to a resilient and crisis-ready Singapore, with community activators leading the way.
In 2023, with the support of GIC, we have evolved the SG Strong Fund into the SG Strong Fellowship, nurturing a network of groundup leaders ready to forge a new frontier for a thriving groundup community",https://www.sgsocialsupport.com/resource/kR45zCNHZaW,No Content Found,"Individuals that have founded and/or are currently leading at least 1 groundup project that has been consistently active for at least the last 2 years in the social, environmental, sports or arts sectors.
